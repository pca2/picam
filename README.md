Simple set of scripts for Raspberry Pi with camera module to detect motion and email photos.
Assumes you're running [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) to detect motion and capture images via the Pi's camera. pymail.py is forked from somewhere but I somehow lost track of its origins.
